## key idea
- 5 trait sets for [*sensitivity*](./link_workwaell): a) habitat/micohabitat specialisation; b) narrow environmental tolerance; c) the potential for disruption of both environmental triggers; d) interspecific interactions; e) rarity
- 2 trait sets for *low adaptive capacity*: a) poor dispersal potential due to low inherent dispersal ability and/or extrinsic  barriers dispersal; b) poor mice-evolutionary potential due to low genetic diversity, long generation lengths and/or low reproductive output
- *exposure* estimated by examining the magnitude of project climatic changes across a species’ distribution, considering relevant parameters to each group, e.g., changes in temperature, precipitation, sea level and hydrological regimes
- all birds, amphibians, warm-water reef-building corals



## key terminology
Sensitivity:
1. specialised habitat (less tightly coupled to specific conditions are likely to be more resilient)
2. physiological tolerance to specific environmental conditions
3. dependence on environment triggers likely to be disrupted by climate change
4. inherent vulnerability of small population, more susceptible to catastrophic events

Low adaptive capacity:
1. poor dispersal ability: intrinsic (low dispersal rate, e.g. land snail) extrinsic (physical/environmental barrier)
2. poor evolvability: potential for rapid genetic change (low genetic diversity, low genotypic variation, reproductive rates and outputs)



## methodology
classify the worst impacted 25% species as of highest vulnerability. Thus the result is relative rather than absolute CCV.



## caveats
- combinations of ordinal and categorical data poses challenges for assigning the threshold needed to distinguish relatively high versus low CCV. If no empirical basis for selecting trait thresholds existed, expert-informed thresholds were used.
- due to methodology of relative, the result indicates which species are likely to be at greatest risk, but cannot be used to infer how many species will be impacted, nor to compare vulnerability between taxonomic groups
- *important* CCV scores must be interpreted as relative measures and comparisons of percentage of CCV species between taxonomic groups is not meaningful



## other information
- IPCC and Thomas et al studies: species distribution (bioclimatic envelope) models, which use correlations between species’s observed distributions and climate variables to predict their distribution and their extinction risk under future climate scenarios



## thinking and ideas for the CCV WH study
- policy relevance:
- projection of species range distribution and impact on WH (biodiv)
- OUV, criteria (x) sites. Broadly considers both crit 9 and 10, conservation of species and outstanding biological processes
- analysis comparing WH, adjacent PA
