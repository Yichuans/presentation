note: 1. thank Ni Huan, GLY 2. why use English 3. style of presentation, interactive,


### About my career, so far
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
note: 1. academic career ZJU, HKU, Cam: worked hard, played hard; another non Chinese speaking world; Got lucky, Cam, harry potter; 2. professional career, IUCN, WCMC, CI: beginners mind, could not speak the language - robert, robot; learning english thank technical; technical competence in maths and coding in non- technical field; international, tolerance situational leadership


## Topic 
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
Area based biodiversity conservation - convention, communication and conversation
note: the more you learn, the more you know that you don't know, quite nervous, inadverdently misleading bright minds astray, career from doctors, to conservation; but thinking back, Wen Cambridge, look back do not remember, not information but thinking process 


## Outline
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
of the presentation
- problem statement
- framework: global conventions
- mechanism: between science and policy
- effectiveness: story telling

note: based on my experience and my understanding, the content might or might not be of interest but i hope the thinking process behind it might be useful and relevant.


## Problem statement
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
note: the most difficult - the better one understands the problem the better one is able to provide a solution

### climate change
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
note: question, what is it, asking students to describe, why is it a problem?

### loss of biodiversity
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
note: question, what is it...


## challenges of solutions 
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
- facts - is this really happening
- how - governance, finance, equity and development, implementation
note: again, describe evidence, and then how


## convention
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
note: UN bore the world to peace. why: 1. treaties, rules to dictate how we work, in coordination internationally; e.g. Vienna convention for the protection of ozone layer. UNFCCC + CBD. 2. framework for work to happen, e.g. setting goals, workplan, task force etc


### biodiversity and conventions
- conserve species
- conserve area/habitat
note: education, technology + 


## communication
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
note: 


## conversation
<!-- .slide: data-background="./generic_assets/wcmc-1.jpg" -->
note: you'd be surprised how everything works. Money does talk - who funds it, who gets the funding; interest groups; perhaps science isn't the most effective way to mobilise support; powerful individuals; technology plays a role; documentation; celebrity and social influencer; story telling is important; decisions are not always rational but influenced or even in some cases driven by emotions (brexit); strong belief is more powerful than dry facts 


## recommendation of books
