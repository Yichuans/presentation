# Challenges
and lessons learned
note: hugely complex project, slow consultation, provision of information, and decision

# 25% over budget
£50K over £200K now, est additional £16K overrun 
note: 1. not to interpret only the contract but to deliver a product fully consulted and A class 2. reported in the last GC, try to mitigate by having a clear flow: of design, sign-off and implement, most milestone missed

# 4 months delay
Original delivery 28 Sep 2018, now 31 Jan 2018
note: ask for money; migration, deployment, API risks have all occurred, but there has been no budgetary response - they were identified but no contingency in the contract to cover. Would kindly consider the challenge and agree to extra budget
