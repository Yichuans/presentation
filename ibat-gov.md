# Remains...

## estimate 159 developer days remaining

## (or 5 developers full time 6 weeks)


# Budget
15 August 2018
note: because of the above changes. It's hard to put an accurate figure on current spending

## 2/3 spent, > 1/2 delivered

## WCMC estimated to go above budget by 20%


# Timeline and Sprints
15 August 2018

## four sprints to go

## reports and user management system


# Challenges

## capacity
note: the reason behind underspending per projection; according to technical lead, the busiest time in four years; 
added capacity, including an agency frontend developer; channel, prioritise developer time. projected to substantially increases in the remaining Sprints

## communications
note: involving four partners, multiple committees. Try to keep partners informed, everything is shared - all planners including finance forecast, at the finest level is available, understand time is limited. Nevertheless, memory Fine details requires approval, not most effective
Involving more time, We have document and communicate, multiple iterations, and evolving and conflicting features, put in writing, what has agreed by whom and when, parked decisions and deferred, actions points to follow up. Take opportunities of show and tell, direct + high level communication

## decision making
note: redevelopment is not replication. We took the opportunity to re-open topics of interest, from user journey perspective, what makes intepretation easy. For example, scientists and business actors may be different. Compromises are made. Views, priorities are different - sometimes they come directly to the implementing team, without communicating to ER and her agreement. Lack of proper consultation
We have clearer decision making process, also imperative that we adopt this approach to ensure timely delivery now.
GC could strengthen this mechanism and provide clear instruction of decision making process

## estimate
note: IBAT is a complex system, evolved through multiple engineering cycles. Some complexities have not been and cannot fully captured in the proposal stage. For example, reports as budgeted in the contract do not reflect at all the unique requirement of individual report type that by itself contain technical complexity as well as business challenges such as consultation and agreement. For example he data filters have gone through 3 iterations after consultation. These are important overhead but nevertheless not been budgeted sufficiently. 
This will likely result in increased project time and expenditure.
note: we have the capacity to delivery, contingent to the above challenges being resolved
